            send keys and tokens in headers, never cookies, so this is the usual
            setting for a backend-as-a-service. Environments can narrow it per
            publishable key with ``settings.cors_origins``.
        key_cache_ttl: Seconds a resolved API key is cached (Sillo cache).
        rate_limit, rate_window: Requests per window, per key or client address.
        max_body_bytes: Largest request body forwarded (uploads included).
        upstream_timeout: Seconds to wait for an upstream response.
