class ApiSettings(PlatformSettings):
    """API settings.

    Attributes:
        database_url: The platform database: projects, definitions, activity.
        db_generate_schemas: Create tables at startup. For tests and throwaway
            setups only; migrations own the schema otherwise.
        default_data_url: Where an environment's Resource data lives when the
            developer has not configured a database. ``{project}`` and
            ``{env}`` are substituted, so environments never share a database.
        storage_root: Local storage root, used when the platform default is the
            ``local`` driver.
        storage_driver: The default object storage for environments that have
            not configured their own (``local``, ``s3`` or ``memory``). Empty
            means automatic: ``s3`` when ``storage_endpoint`` is set (MinIO, AWS
            S3, R2, any S3-compatible service), else ``local``. The Docker
            install points ``storage_endpoint`` at its bundled MinIO.
        storage_endpoint, storage_bucket, storage_region, storage_access_key,
        storage_secret_key, storage_prefix: The S3-compatible service and the
            remote bucket every Pawabase bucket lives in (as key prefixes).
        storage_public_endpoint: Where browsers reach the service, for presigned
            URLs, when ``storage_endpoint`` is an internal address.
        storage_path_style: Address the bucket in the URL path (MinIO, Ceph)
            rather than as a subdomain (AWS virtual-hosted style).
        request_retention_days: How long request history (the traces behind route
            statistics) is kept. ``0`` keeps it forever.
        code_path: Where project code (functions, routes, policies) is mounted.
        deployments_path: Where uploaded function artifacts live (a writable volume shared by the API, workers and scheduler); defaults to
            ``<code_path>/.deployments``, which is wrong when ``code_path`` is a read-only mount.
        public_url: The gateway's public origin, used in signed URLs and docs.
        inline_worker: Run a queue worker inside the API process. Right for a
            single-process development setup with no Redis; production runs
            ``python -m app.worker`` separately.
        inline_scheduler: Likewise for the scheduler.
