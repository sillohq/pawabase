"""Pawabase policies as Sillo storage policies.

Sillo's :class:`~sillo.storage.Bucket` asks its policy two questions:
``allows(action, key, user)`` and ``signable(action)``. This adapter answers the
first from a Pawabase policy, with the object key and the path segments of the
key available to the condition::

    {"eq": ["$object.segments.0", "$auth.user_id"]}   # users/<id>/... layout

Sillo's storage API is synchronous at the policy boundary, so only JSON
conditions are accepted here. Python policies are enforced in the storage
routes, before the bucket is called.
